    "In this project, we will explain the A* search algorithm (Informed search algorithms) and how it depends on the principle of (Dijkstra) shortest path to give us a better and faster solution. Also, we will explain the difference between Manhattan, Euclidean, and Chebyshev distance when we are dealing with problems that are related to finding the shortest path between two things. It does this by introducing a heuristic element to decide the node that is supposed to be followed.\n",

    "# What is the A* search algorithm?\n",
    "A* is an informed search algorithm, sometimes known as a best-first search because it is written in terms of weighted graphs. Its goal is to discover the shortest path from a given starting node to a particular goal node (least distance traveled, shortest time, etc.). It accomplishes this by keeping track of a tree of pathways that begin at the start node and extending those paths one edge at a time until the termination requirement is met.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Heuristic function?\n",
    "is a function in search algorithms that rates alternatives depending on available information at each branching step to determine which branch to take. There is 5 behavior for heuristic:\n",
    "1. If the heuristic is 0 then the actual cost g(n) will only be used, and A* will be turned into Dijkstraâ€™s algorithms\n",
    "1. If the heuristic is lower than the actual path, then A* will guarantee the shortest path,  and the more heuristic being lower the more expanded node happens.\n",
    "1. If the heuristic is the same as an actual path, then A* will find the shortest path with exact step without expanding any unnecessary node\n",
    "1. If the heuristic is greater than the actual path, the A* may not guarantee the shortest path, but it will run faster\n",
    "1. If the heuristic is greater by an extreme factor, the A* will turn into Gready algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "We will test most of these in this tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Euclidean distance:\n",
    "Euclidean distance is The shortest path between source and destination or between a point and another, which is usually described by a straight line. It is useful for things like locating the closest hospital for an emergency helicopter flight. When constructing a suitability map, this tool may also be used to obtain data representing the distance from a certain item.\t\n",
    "\n",
    "## Manhattan distance:\n",
    "If we need to determine the distance between two data points on a grid-like route, we utilize Manhattan distance. For Example, if we want to calculate the distance from a place to another and we are moved by a vehicle then we will consider that we will face a lot of obstacles or walls so in that case, we will need to turn in another direction to continue moving. So, we need to use Manhattan distance.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Chebyshev distance:\n",
    "The biggest difference between two vectors along any coordinate dimension is known as the Chebyshev distance. To put it another way, it's the greatest distance along one axis. Because the smallest number of moves required by a king to move from one square to another is equal to Chebyshev distance, it is sometimes referred to as Chessboard distance. \n",

    "# A* Algorithm:\n",
    "Like Dijkstra, A* works by making a most minimal expense way tree from the beginning hub to the objective hub. What makes A* unique and better for some hunts is that for every hub, A* utilizes a capacity f(n) that gives a gauge of the absolute expense of a way utilizing that hub. Consequently, A* is a heuristic capacity, which contrasts from a calculation in that a heuristic is a greater amount of a gauge and isn't really provably right.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will start implementing the minimum environment for A* to work, then we will take what we learn and change it to interactive and visualize GUI to increase our understanding of the algorithm.\n",
    "## Preparation:\n",
    "Before starting to implement A*, we need an environment for A* to work on. To recap, what we will implement is a maze in the shape of a grid, each cell in the grid will have a value that will be stored in a two-dimensional array, the maze will represent as follow:\n",
    "\n",
    "![image info](./images/Grid.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "It starts from the top left as (0, 0) to the bottom-right (9, 12). Each cell will have the ability to either go in 4 directions or 8 directions. The direction will be controlled by the user.\n",
